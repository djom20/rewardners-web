      <p>Rewardners was created thinking, at all times, in the solution to reduce, and eventually eliminate the use of high amounts of printed material, which every day reaches the mail box  of many users.  We believe that businesses can do their own marketing more efficiently and environmentally conscious, without the use of paper. With the constant use of applications in Smart phones and mobile devices, we firmly believe that it is about time that the use of paper in traditional marketing should be reconsidered, and the ancient traditional way of printing advertising material, should be eliminated. Rewardners is the solution so that users can receive and digitally take with them, all the different coupons that contain promotions and offers of their preferred businesses, or the ones they frequent more, and at the same time they can accumulate and receive prizes for their purchases. We help each day so that such advertising marketing can be digitally replaced in order to reduce the high amount of printed material in every city.</p>
      <p>Through our mobile application we also search for the reduction or elimination of the use of electronic mails, text messages and telemarketing, as advertising media. With this application, we are trying to give the users more importance to the information that they want to receive and take into account for their purchases, according to their own needs. We believe that we can have a better life with a reduced use of paper, with less electronic mails, with less text messages, and less unsolicited phone calls in our homes, offices and cell phones.</p>
